00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:11,790
Rudi: Hello guys, welcome back with us, Team E with Faris as our Captain!

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,030
Rudi: Today is Thursday, October 8th 2020.

3
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,030
Rudi: So today is the voting days,

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,270
Rudi: to choose the best UI Design made by Faris and Azzam. It's been 2 days since they start designing

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,990
Rudi: from October 6th to October 7th 2020. And here we are, October 8th aka the voting days!

6
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,310
Rudi: The voters for today's voting event is me, Rudiansyah Wijaya Pratama,

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:42,950
Rudi: and then my friends: Muhammad Daffa, Ahmad Luhur Pakerti, Akbar Maulana and Ridho Rizqillah

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,590
Rudi: For the 1st designers, Abdullah Azzam, please explain about your improve design!^^

9
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,870
Azzam: Hello guys! lol

10
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,790
Azzam: So I'm gonna review about Tell

11
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,150
Azzam: So here is the Dashboard page of Tell

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:11,990
Azzam: Tell has two...platforms? features? Something like that

13
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,550
Azzam: and those two platforms are Fun Corner and Stories,

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,190
Azzam: If you ever use Secret mobile app, Fun Corner has similar vibe to it

15
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:29,270
Azzam: So, in Fun Corner, we can post anything as anonymous, without name and profile picture

16
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,870
Azzam: and this is how the timeline looks like when you tapped one of the categories in Fun Corner

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,670
Azzam: and this is how the Stories page looks like

18
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,870
Azzam: there's two menu on Stories page: Categories and Latest Stories

19
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,110
Azzam: So, this is what the concept used in Tell:

20
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,150
Azzam: We can freely share anything or post anything without fear

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,030
Azzam: Let's take Twitter as an example

22
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,110
Azzam: If you tweet your opinion, and then the other users is againts your opinion,

23
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,870
Azzam: Your Twitter account might be verbally "attacked" by those who againts you

24
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,910
Azzam: And some of them even try to track your photos, your background, etc etc

25
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,150
Azzam: In Tell, you don't have to fear to go through that kind of hardships because it's anonymous.

26
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,470
Azzam: But,

27
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,870
Azzam: eventhough the concept is great, there are some parts that needs to be improve especially the UI design

28
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,050
Azzam: First,

29
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,510
Azzam: Take a look at this Dashboard page,

30
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,870
Azzam: If you tapped at this bubble chat icon, it gonna brings us to private chat room.

31
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,470
Azzam: But, this Fun Corner icon is also bubble chat, so it's kinda confusing.

32
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,110
Azzam: Because at first I thought that the bubble chat icon on the navbar is a shortcut to Fun Corner timeline,

33
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,110
Azzam: but turned out it's a private chat room.

34
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,590
Azzam: so that's why on one of my design,

35
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,750
Azzam: I changed the Dashboard page UI Design

36
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,660
Azzam: I redesign the Dashboard page,

37
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,670
Azzam: to became like this

38
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,540
Azzam: I'm gonna clicked next repeatedly until I reach the Dashboard page

39
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,950
Azzam: I also changed the bubble chat icon

40
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,020
Azzam: to this mail icon, similar to Twitter's Direct Message.

41
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,220
Azzam: The reason I change the icon, so that users will understand the function of the icon.

42
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,430
Azzam: Because I didn't want users to misunderstood the function of the icon

43
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,660
Azzam: This is one of the stories that posted in Stories page.

44
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,460
Azzam: In Stories page,

45
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,830
Azzam: if the comment section is empty,

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,830
Azzam: the notification line that says "the story doesn't have any bla bla bla" is crashed onto the comment box.

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,430
Azzam: The ways to solve this, is either reduce the cat bowl pic,

48
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,870
Azzam: or, just simply remove the cat bowl pic and left the notification line alone.

49
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,630
Azzam: like what I did in my design, I wrote "No one here yet" so it didn't crashed onto the comment box

50
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,150
Azzam: Because, It's not pleased to see  if the notification line goes onto the comment box

51
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,070
Azzam: That's why i redesigned the comment section to became like this

52
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:27,950
Azzam: On Fun Corner page, there are some categories that you can choose

53
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,350
Azzam: The categories are: Lounge, Education, Beauty, Game, and Arts.

54
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,190
Azzam: If you tapped at Arts, it brings you to the timeline

55
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:42,910
Azzam: But, the users often talked about music and movies on Arts and very rarely users that talked about design, illustration etc

56
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,470
Azzam: So, to avoid the Arts categories became unused,

57
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,730
Azzam: I replace the Arts category

58
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,870
Azzam: with Music and Movies categories

59
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:03,350
Azzam: so that the users will know where to go when they need Music or Movies recommendation

60
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,510
Azzam: that's the reason why I replace it

61
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,390
Azzam: I also add Confession as one of the new categories,

62
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,950
Azzam: If you ever know the Twitter automenfess that tweet your confession, it has the similar vibe to it

63
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,230
Azzam: But, in Twitter automenfess, you have to be followed by the Twiter base account first in order to tweet your confession

64
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,310
Azzam: Meanwhile, on Fun Corner, you don't have to be followed by anyone

65
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,470
Azzam: You can freely confess anything you want, everytime and everywhere

66
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,990
Azzam: I also add Book as a new category
(p.s. so when users want to read something, they can go here)

67
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,830
Azzam: This is how the timeline in Education category looks like

68
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,110
Azzam: As you can see, there's big notification bar right below the Education bar,

69
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,750
Azzam: and IMO, the notification bar needs to be remove

70
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,710
Azzam: Well, visually, how to say it, umm

71
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:01,790
Azzam: For me personally, it didn't visually pleased to see (gosh i sound harsh:( )

72
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:09,630
Azzam: and it makes me didn't want to spend a long time here (omg i really sound harsh...)

73
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,990
Azzam: That's why I redesigned the timeline to became like this,

74
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,350
Azzam: if I tapped on Music category, it brings me to this timeline

75
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,310
Azzam: *gibberish*

76
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,830
Azzam: I made the timeline look like this so that it's visually pleased to see

77
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,870
Azzam: and the reason why I made the timeline looks like a group chat in Line,

78
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,790
Azzam: is because here we can post anything as anonymous,

79
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:47,350
Azzam: i want to create a familiar and safe atmosphere like in a group chat

80
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,310
Azzam: because in a group chat, you can express anything you want without burden

81
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,590
Azzam: and you feel at ease when you talked to your friend, right?

82
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,630
Azzam: that's why i want to create that kind of atmosphere

83
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:06,750
Azzam: I also want the users to feel as if they're reading chats from friends instead of timeline

84
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,910
Azzam: On Fun Corner,

85
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,790
Azzam: it didn't have a search feature,

86
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,350
Azzam: thus we can't search any keywords or posts

87
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,070
Azzam: Let's say we read a post on one of Fun Corner's categories, and we want to read the posts again,

88
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:31,510
Azzam:  all we can do is scroll through the timeline. We can't search the post with keywords

89
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,790
Azzam: That's why I add a search feature on my design

90
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,390
Azzam: so the user can easily search any post they want. Let's say we're on Music category,

91
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:51,790
Azzam: and we want a song recommendation from A singer or B singer, we can simply use the search feature

92
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,070
Azzam: My conclusion is, you can search anything with search feature

93
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,590
Azzam: because on Tell, we have to scroll all the way down the timeline to find what we're looking for,

94
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,870
Azzam: and it's kinda wasting time. That's why I add the search feature

95
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,070
Azzam: Okay now we're going on the Stories page,

96
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,710
Azzam: The Stories page UI is a bit different compared to the Fun Corner page

97
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,750
Azzam: IMO, the Stories page UI should be the same with the Fun Corner page,

98
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,950
Azzam: On Stories page it also has Categories menu, so I think it's better

99
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,300
Azzam: to make the Stories page UI exactly the same as the Fun Corner UI

100
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Azzam: and for the Latest Category menu,
(p.s. on Stories page)

101
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,230
Azzam: I think it's better to placed it inside the Categories

102
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:45,750
Azzam: This is my redesigned work of the Stories page. I made it exactly the same as the Fun Corner

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,390
Azzam: The reason is, I want the users to know that Stories is still part of Tell.

104
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,890
Azzam: *gibberish*

105
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,070
Azzam: *repeated the same lines again*

106
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,790
Azzam: If we tapped at one of the Categories,

107
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,710
Azzam: this is how the timeline looks
(p.s. this is my redesigned work)

108
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:14,470
Azzam: I got inspired by Quora, that's why I made the timeline similar to it, and that's why they have profile pic

109
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,390
Azzam: and if you tapped on one of the title of the stories, the story gonna looks like this

110
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,590
Azzam: The reason I redesigned the story's interface is,

111
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,710
Azzam: Because on Tell, the story's interface is look like this

112
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:29,470
Azzam: and we need to click the "v" button if we wanna read the whole story.

113
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:37,710
Azzam: Because, IMO, I want the users to read the whole story once they clicked the title

114
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:52,270
Azzam: This interface also occurs at Quora, Medium etc, and I think it's a basic interface of a long-text-post.
(p.s. yes I got inspired by them)

115
00:09:52,350 --> 00:10:01,150
Azzam: I prefer my redesigned work of story's post because it's visually pleased to read the whole story (rip my english)

116
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:14,510
Azzam: *repeated the explanation again and again...*

117
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,630
Azzam: And then,

118
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,150
Azzam: I also redesigned the Dashboard page

119
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,150
Azzam: Because the original Dashboard page on Tell,

120
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,230
Azzam: IMO is quite empty, there's only this big illustration and menus for Fun Corner and Stories

121
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,710
Azzam: another reason is, the two menu should be the hightlight of the Dashboard page

122
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,990
Azzam: but this big illustration steals the spotlight from the menu

123
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:45,150
Azzam: IMO, the dashboard page shouldn't be empty, take a look at Shopee, Twitter and Instagram. It's quite packed, right?

124
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,110
Azzam: That's why I redesigned the Dashboard page to became look like this

125
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,670
Azzam: I also add the "Popular on Stories" menu on the Dashboard page

126
00:10:52,670 --> 00:11:03,510
Azzam: to provoke users's curiousity about the most popular Stories and make the users want to read it

127
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:12,430
Azzam: especially if there's a story with unique title, I'm pretty sure that users gonna interest to read it

128
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,390
Azzam: "Popular on Stories" indeed has a similar vibe to "Trending", so the users will know what is the most popular stories right now

129
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,310
Azzam: I also add the "Trending on Fun Corner" menu, to inform the users the most discussed topic in Fun Corner

130
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:31,550
Azzam: bcs Fun Corner is a place where you can freely ask, confess or write as anonymous,

131
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:39,190
Azzam: You also can freely discussed about anything, and thanks to Trending on Fun Corner,

132
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,710
Azzam: the users became aware of the most discussed or the most answered question on Fun Corner

133
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,390
Azzam: I want the users feel like, take the 1st trending topic as example,  "Oh there's this interesting topic about Kotlin vs Java,

134
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,550
Azzam: as a Kotlin developer, I think Kotlin is way better than Java, I want to give my opinion too."

135
00:11:51,820 --> 00:12:03,390
Azzam: *gibberish* *gibberish*
My conclusion, I want to make the users triggered to join the discussion about a topic

136
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:10,150
Azzam: Take the 2nd trending topic, if the users choose the "Tahu Bulat Team", then they definitely join the discussion

137
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:23,910
Azzam: *gibberish* *repeated the same explanation over and over...*

138
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,110
Azzam: If you look at my redesigned work of Dashboard page, you might be wondering: "where is two button that brings to Fun Corner and Stories?"

139
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,630
Azzam: "We can't get in the Fun Corner or Stories page because you didn't make the two buttons"

140
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,870
Azzam: Relax, I changed those two buttons into this electronic banner, like the one in Shopee

141
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,990
Azzam: On Shopee, if you clicked one of the electronic banners, it brings you to the page related

142
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:51,390
Azzam: My electronic banners work exactly the same, if you clicked on Fun Corner, it brings you to the Fun Corner page

143
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,310
Azzam: *talking to myself* Where is it? where's my Fun Corner page?

144
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,790
Azzam: *still talking to myself* Ah, here it is!

145
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:05,550
Azzam: So, if you clicked at Fun Corner banner, it brings you to the Fun Corner page, it also applied to the Stories page as well

146
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:12,830
Azzam: *gibberish* *gibberish*

147
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,990
Azzam: The reason I change those two button is,

148
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,710
Azzam: because there's a wide left space above the "Popular on Stories" menu and below the "Welcome" greetings message

149
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,710
Azzam: and I ran out of ideas on how to design those two buttons and where to place it,

150
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:29,670
Azzam: so I made the electronic banner instead, similar concept to Shopee's.

151
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,030
Azzam: I also add the drop-down menu (correction, its name is hamburger menu) on the Dashboard page

152
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,670
Azzam: Inside the hamburger menu, there's My Profile, My Post, My Stories, My Bookmark and My Library.

153
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:48,550
Azzam: My Profile, like its name, when we tapped it, it brings us to the Profile page

154
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:57,510
Azzam: Because, on the original Profile page on Tell... *talking to myself* where is it? I think I forgot to screenshot the profile page

155
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:03,110
Azzam: Anyway, the original Profile page on Tell is located INSIDE the Stories page

156
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,430
Azzam: so the Profile page isn't located in Settings
(p.s. usually, Profile page located either on Settings or navbar)

157
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:15,790
Azzam: Eventhough we're anonymous, but I think the Profile page is quite crucial

158
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:29,590
Azzam: IMO, I think it's either removed the Profile page so we became totally anonymous or move the Profile page to Dashboard page

159
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,030
Faris: Zam
Azzam: Huh?
Faris: I sent the screenshot of the original Profile page

160
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,150
Azzam: Ah, here is the original Profile page looks like. As you can see, it placed inside the Stories page

161
00:14:53,150 --> 00:15:00,430
Azzam: Like I said before, it better placed on the Dashboard page

162
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:07,990
Azzam: because it's easier for the users to access it

163
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,550
Azzam: Let's continue. This "My Post" is here refers to our post on Fun Corner

164
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:20,510
Azzam: The function is, to let users know every posts they posted,

165
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:28,440
Azzam: and, let's say you want to delete one of your cringiest post because you regret it,

166
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:36,790
Azzam: Instead of scrolling all the way down on timeline,

167
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:42,430
Azzam: the users can simply just tap the My Post page and it brings them to every post they made

168
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,640
Azzam: and then the users can choose which post they want to delete. It's much more easier, right?

169
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,630
Azzam: Let's continue. This "My Stories" function is exactly the same as the original one:

170
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,630
Azzam: to inform the users about every stories they wrote.

171
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,550
Azzam: it also have the same purposed with "My Post", makes the users easier to access it,

172
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,150
Azzam: especially if the users want to edit or delete their stories.

173
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,510
Azzam: The original one also has the same function but all I did was move the original "My Stories" from Stories page to Dashboard Page

174
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,710
Azzam: Let's continue. This "My Bookmark" function is a collection of every stories that the users bookmarked.

175
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:27,350
Azzam: Instead of scrolling all the way down the timeline to find stories that the users bookmarked,

176
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:31,750
Azzam: it's better collect it into one page named "My Bookmark", so that the users can easily reach too

177
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:38,190
Azzam: *giberish* *talking nonsense*

178
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:44,550
Azzam: Let's continue. This "My Library" function is similar to library in Wattpad:

179
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:54,830
Azzam: to inform users about stories that they currently read or finished read, or

180
00:16:54,830 --> 00:17:01,270
Azzam: Let's say you currently read a long story, but bcs you're busy you're only able to read it halfway,

181
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,030
Azzam: and when your work is done and you want to resume reading, intead of scrolling all the way down to find that story,

182
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,270
Azzam: You can easily tap the "My Library" menu on Dashboard page to find the stories that you're looking for.

183
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,110
Azzam: So you can easily resume reading from the Dashboard page

184
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:18,230
Azzam: That's it from me. Feel free if you want to look at all my redesigned work:)

185
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,270
Azzam: This is the Fun Corner page

186
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:31,150
Azzam: I want to recreate this page as similar as the original one bcs all I did was add 4 categories:

187
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,270
Azzam: Confession, Book, Music and Movie,

188
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,550
Azzam: but bcs the lack of the resources that's why I made this page look like this

189
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:45,070
Azzam: *gibberish* *talking nonsense*

190
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,710
Azzam: So, I have friend who goods at Graphic Design,

191
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,870
Azzam: He's majored in Interior Design at Bandung Institute of Technology,

192
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,950
Azzam: and he told me that

193
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,590
Azzam: if we want to design or draw something, it's important to determine the color palettes

194
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,990
Azzam: Color palettes are colors that we use and we want the colors to fill our designs or draws

195
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,590
Azzam: so that the designs or draws have matching colors and blend well together

196
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,310
Azzam: Let's say we want to use bright yellow as one of our color palette,

197
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:17,110
Azzam: we have to use bright yellow everytime we want to color our design yellow, and don't change it to darker yellow

198
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,910
Azzam: unless that is the concept of your design, don't use bright yellow and darker yellow everytime you want color your design yellow

199
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,310
Azzam: If you take a look at the original design, the colors don't match and don't blend well

200
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,990
Azzam: at first it's perfect combination of blue and yellow, but at Beauty icon the color combination suddenly change

201
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:33,310
Azzam: with blue and grey, and at Arts icon the colors change too---it's a mix up colors to create a colorful atmosphere

202
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,310
Azzam: In conclusion, the color palettes don't match and don't blend well

203
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,710
Azzam: And, if you look closely at the "header" of Fun Corner, there's a low-opacity-couch and on Lounge icon, there's a normal-opacity-couch

204
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,310
Azzam: Personally, it's quite unsightly

205
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,390
Azzam: That's why on my redesigned work, I used the normal-opacity-couch on Fun Corner header

206
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,780
Azzam: so that the couch didn't blend with the background

207
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,780
Azzam: I also used matching colors that blends well together as my color palettes so it's visually pleased to see

208
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,030
Azzam: my color palettes are blue, brown etc etc

209
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,270
Azzam: my color palettes also avoid unmatching color palettes like the original Fun Corner page

210
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,990
Azzam: Because at first I already decided to use this three (actually, it's four, sorry) colors as my color palette

211
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,330
Azzam: so that my design would has matching colors that blends well together

212
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,070
Azzam: Oh, I forgot to explain about this profile pic

213
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:14,990
Azzam: I knew that Tell supposed to be anonymous, so this profile pic is a pack that comes with Tell,

214
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:21,190
Azzam: so Tell should provide a pack of profile pic to keep the users anonymous.
(p.s. or Tell can sell the pack)

215
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:29,910
Azzam: *talking nonsense* *Stutter*

216
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:35,990
Azzam: Because, IMO, it's a bit weird to see a post without a profile pic

217
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,110
Azzam: I don't know why, but it kinda makes me feel weird to see a post without profile pic

218
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:45,150
Azzam: That's why I add the profile pic that comes with the app
(p.s. so the users can't upload their own pic)

219
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,150
Azzam: so that we will not know the other user's identity

220
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,470
Azzam: It's possible for women to use men as their profile pic to keep them anonymous

221
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,030
Azzam: I think that's it...

222
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,750
Azzam: Oh, I also redesigned the comment section on Fun Corner too

223
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,230
Azzam: I redesigned it to became look like this

224
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,510
Azzam: My friend once asked me that bcs my Fun Corner timeline's inspired by a Line group chat,

225
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,470
Azzam: "Why I didn't adopt the concept of reply in a Line group chat?"
(p.s. if you have Line then you'll understand what he means)

226
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,580
Azzam: *stuttering* *gibberish*

227
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:26,390
Azzam: Because, on Line group chat, if you reply to someone's message, your reply will placed right above their message

228
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,320
Azzam: But, IMO,

229
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,270
Azzam: I think it's gonna spam the timeline. Let's say there's a popular post about "Is Earth Round, Flat, or Hoax?",

230
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:42,260
Azzam: and those post got so many replies, it's definitely gonna spam the timeline

231
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,020
Azzam: Because those replies gonna appear on timeline everytime someone reply to it

232
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,550
Azzam: That's why I didn't adopt that concept and made the comment section to look like this

233
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,350
Azzam: and here I'm gonna show off all my redesigned work

234
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,910
Faris: I think you already chosen, Jam

235
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:11,510
Azzam: This is my redesigned work about Fun Corner's timeline

236
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,310
Azzam: This is my design about Search feature on Fun Corner

237
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,750
Azzam: There are also "Recent" and "Popular" tab in Search page, I got inspired by Twitter

238
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:27,870
Azzam: So that we can sort our search' result based on how recent or how popular the posts

239
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:35,230
Azzam: and the search result gonna look like this, the keyword got "bold". I also got inspired by Twitter

240
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,190
Azzam: This is my redesigned work of Stories page

241
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:47,310
Azzam: There's reason why I used icon to represent the category

242
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,910
Azzam: Because on the original Stories page they used this flat shape

243
00:21:51,300 --> 00:22:02,790
Azzam: This also show the inconsistency of Tell, because on Fun Corner page they used icons but on Stories page they used flat-shape

244
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,670
Azzam: *gibberish*

245
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:13,470
Azzam: IMO, if they used icon on Fun Corner, they should use icon too for Stories to show their consistency

246
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:20,630
Azzam: That's why on my design, I used icons for both Fun Corner page and Stories page

247
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:29,630
Azzam: As you can see, the background color for each category is different. The color is the identity for each category

248
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,070
Azzam: The reason is, because on my Dashboard page design,
(p.s. well, Popular on Stories to be more spesific)

249
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:40,350
Azzam: right below the "Popular on Stories", there's titles of stories, and each title has different background color

250
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,990
Azzam: so that the users will know the category of each title, such as this "Dear Mantan" that recognizeable as Love category

251
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,070
Azzam: and if the users interested in Love category, they maybe wanna click the title to read the whole story

252
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:52,350
Azzam: *repeat the same exact explanation*

253
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,670
Azzam: Because if there's no identity color, Let's take "Dear Mantan" as example,

254
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,670
Azzam: what if the users assume that Dear Mantan's category is Love and decided to read it but turned out it's a Horror story?

255
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,470
Azzam: and the "Mantan" (ex boyfriend/girlfriend) here is a ghost?

256
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,390
Faris: and then the ghost get married lol

257
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,550
Azzam: *laugh*
Well I made my point clear

258
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:15,190
Azzam: *mention the category for each title displayed in order*
Love, Horror, Comedy

259
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,510
Azzam: *repeat the exact same explanation again*

260
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:23,150
Azzam: as for the identity colors, Pink is for Love,

261
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,270
Azzam: Light Blue for School and A-bit-darker Blue for Education,

262
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,110
Azzam: FYI, there's a concept behind this light blue - darker blue color,

263
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:35,110
Azzam: School has light blue to show that its stage of education journey is lower than College,

264
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,110
Azzam: and the light blue's hexcode if it gets staged it became darker as well

265
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,590
Azzam: My point is, light blue represent School and when it gets to the next stage, it goes darker blue, which represent College

266
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,190
Azzam: Let's continue. As for Horror, the color identity is dark blue, which darker than College

267
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,150
Azzam: because, if you ever look closely, the night sky color is dark-blue,

268
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:02,270
Azzam: thus, it's not dark-black, but dark-blue, a very-dark-blue

269
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,790
Azzam: I think that's it...
If you click at one of the categories on Stories,

270
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:09,030
Azzam: it brings you to this page.

271
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:17,710
Azzam: At first, I used the identity color of the category to fill the header-color,

272
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,950
Azzam: but, I think the header-identity-color doesn't blend well with the font-color, so it's not visually pleased to see

273
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:29,590
Azzam: so I recolored the header into navy blue again to keep Tell's identity
(p.s. Navy Blue is Tell's identity color)

274
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:36,430
Azzam: and here how the timeline of Stories page looks like, I got inspired by Quora
(gosh why do I keep repeating the exact same explanation over and over)

275
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,950
Azzam: and if you clicked one of the title, it brings you to this page
(omg I hate myself for keep repeating the exact same explanation)

276
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,790
Azzam: and if you clicked the Love buttons, its collor change

277
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,990
Azzam: *laugh* lol I'm just gonna show off *laugh*
Faris: *laugh*

278
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,110
Azzam: I think that's it

279
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,350
Azzam: and this is my design when the users want to report story,

280
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:10,230
Azzam: but it's useless becaue Tell already covered it

281
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,870
Azzam: Oh, I forgot to mention that I separated the comment section from story

282
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:23,310
Azzam: So, instead of the comment section placed right below the story,

283
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,430
Azzam: I think it's better to separate it.

284
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:32,510
Azzam: Because, usually, on forum page, they separated the forum post and the comment section into another page

285
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,630
Azzam: another reason is, with separated comment section like this, you can be more focused to read the comment

286
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,550
Azzam: because, if the comment section placed right below the post, if you read the comment till the bottom

287
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,670
and want to go back to timeline, it's kinda tiring to scroll up

288
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:52,590
Azzam: so, i think it's better to separated the comment section from story to be more focused

289
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,430
Azzam: I think that's it

290
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,820
Azzam: Here's my Dashboard page design

291
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,230
Azzam: And here's my hamburger page design

292
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,830
Azzam: That's it. The end. Hehe...

293
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,550
Azzam: That's it, guys, hehe

294
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:13,720
Azzam:There is a bug from the application, So I have been send a content.

295
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Adi:Is this application have dark mode?

296
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,600
Azzam:I haven't thought about getting into dark mode yet.

297
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,720
*Little Laughing*

298
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,900
*Talking Gibberish*

299
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:31,050
Azzam: But I have been upload a content in Education Category at Fun Corner mode.

300
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,050
Azzam: As you can see it says "fun main print hello world".

301
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:40,170
Azzam: But when I saw my post, it turned out that there were comments.

302
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:48,040
Azzam: and I don't get notifications that my post is commented or likes by other people.

303
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,010
Azzam: Well, there is bug in this application that users didn't get notifications of their post.

304
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:58,110
Azzam: Therfore the user should be informated in notification button. and this enough.

305
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,670
Azzam: and as we can see there is an information column containing ios version is coming soon.

306
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:09,510
Azzam: I think this is too much wasting of place.

307
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:14,440
Azzam: and that is one of the reason why I created electronic banner in this place.

308
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,500
Azzam: So that developer can provide information.

309
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,980
Azzam: For example if the developer want to informate the user that "Tell" will release in ios

310
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,300
Azzam: They can input to electronic banner.

311
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:26,520
Azzam: Like that. I think is enough for me. Thank You. Returned to Rudi.

312
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,570
Rudi: Hello Azzam.

313
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,830
Rudi: Oke for the explanation is done but there is a missing topic

314
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:40,300
Azzam: What?
Rudi: That yesterday we have discussed the "don't ask me again" checkbox.

315
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,980
Azzam: Ah I see the checkbox.

316
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,940
Rudi: Maybe...

317
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,010
Faris: Which one?

318
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,300
Rudi: The checkbox that..

319
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,980
Azzam: The checkbox button to don't ask me again.

320
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,570
Faris: Oh that one. I think that will discuss another time because I also design it yet.

321
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,620
Rudi: Ok Ok

322
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:01,910
Rudi: and one again, there is joined this discussion who name is Farhan Dewanta Syahputra

323
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,910
Rudi: Because of Azzam has presented his designs,

324
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,750
Rudi: We will continue with the explanation of Faris. Please Faris.

325
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,190
Azzam: Please Faris.

326
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:18,880
Faris: Okay maybe i will explain that my design is not as much as Azzam. Because I am more concern to User Interaction

327
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,430
Faris: and also because there are not many resources, so my design is likely the design is simple.

328
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,710
Faris: Oke we are going to stories page.

329
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,720
Faris: Where is it Azzam?

330
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
Azzam: Go to left. Again.

331
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,010
Faris: Oh this one.

332
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:42,300
Faris: So the stories like this before and I change the design into this.

333
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,270
Faris: Well I made 2 tab containing latest stories and categories.

334
00:28:49,270 --> 00:29:02,030
Faris: In latest stories, there is also categories for each post so that everyone knows that the post belongs to any category.

335
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:11,190
Faris: Then in the "Tell" like Azzam tells before in fact that is not "My Profile" but there is "My Stories".

336
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,550
Faris: So the stories that have been created by users are there.

337
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,890
Azzam: But the typoghraphy is "My Profile" there.

338
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,710
Faris: Yes it should be "My Stories"

339
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:30,260
Faris: and also in "Tell", if we want to make a story we must go to "My Profile" then click "Create new story".

340
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:37,710
Faris: But in my design, I added a button to create a story directly. So you don't have to go to "My Profile" first.

341
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,030
Faris: Oke next if we want to make a story, then it will look like this.

342
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,030
Faris: There is I created the terms that the word must have minimum 99 characters.

343
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,970
Faris: So in "Tell", to make a story I have been calculated must have minimum 99 characters.

344
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:54,650
Faris: Because I have tried to make a row of word then the next button is cannot clicked.

345
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
Faris: So that is make a user confused.

346
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,700
Faris: Because of that I make a term must 99 characters with a status also.

347
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,460
Faris: Then for the rest of all the same as "Tell".

348
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,150
Faris: In stories, the display is like this. Just as Azzam said, the design is lacking.

349
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,510
Faris: I don't know why if i think that the design is bearable because there is remaining sections

350
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,260
Faris: Why there should be dropdown button

351
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,120
Faris: and why there is just be displayed a half

352
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,570
Faris: Because my opinion the ideal of the design is if we click the story will display all of story.

353
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,580
Azzam: Yes like that.

354
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,650
Faris: Don't want to see the story and comments at the same time except like the post before.

355
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:40,420
Faris: Because that is like an anonymous chat and everyone also want to see chat and comment by other people inside the post.

356
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:51,870
Faris: So in stories I create like this, I make the comments columns to pull up button and the story will display fully.

357
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,290
Faris: This is I made this a little bit because I was lazy.

358
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,010
Faris: Yaa approxiately like this.

359
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,920
Faris: As I tell before there are 2 tabs contains categories and stories maybe not much different from Azzam,

360
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,650
Faris: but I only used the icon because the reources I get are only that much.

361
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,990
Faris: I think approxiatley same with Azzam.

362
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:17,050
Faris: If we click "College Live" menu will display like this.

363
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,310
Faris: In this room I gave it a sepcial color for marking that this is a "College Live" view.

364
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:29,630
Faris: It also will not affected to "Tell" identity

365
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:36,570
Faris: It's just to mark the room of "College Live".

366
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,030
Faris: There is also I don't given the genre because everyone is sure to know the categories.

367
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,110
Faris: Okay for the categories is enough.

368
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:49,830
Faris: and approxiately like this.

369
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,210
Faris: Because the main features is stories and fun corner.

370
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:07,170
Faris: Okay next to fun corner.

371
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,290
Faris: Actually in fun corner I didn't add much

372
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:16,790
Faris: just only change the primary color

373
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:23,830
Faris: and use the icon to keep it simple because my target is make it simple.

374
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:31,950
Faris: In fun corner also like Azzam, I separated art menu to music and movie menu.

375
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,030
Faris: and then next to......

376
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,730
Faris: This is the diplay of fun corner before.

377
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,190
Faris: In my design also didn't change too much

378
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,470
Faris: Like for example in games room the display approxiately like this.

379
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,210
Faris: In this room user can also make a direct post.

380
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:01,810
Faris: Then if user want to read a post it will display like this.

381
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:13,790
Faris: Why directly I displayed the comments because I likens the the comments like a anonymous chat

382
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:20,370
Faris: and the interactions between senders and commenters will be more more pronounced.

383
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,410
Faris: For post approxiately same and not much different, only.....

384
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:38,890
Faris: if in the stories there is heading 1, heading 2 etc to make a title style, list style etc.

385
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,050
Faris: But in post I just make simple display like a character terms and next button.

386
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,250
Faris: Yaa just like that.

387
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:48,590
Faris: Simple.

388
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,310
Rudi: enough?
Faris: yes enough.

389
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,410
Rudi: Okay jump to next event.

390
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:11,110
Rudi: Enter at the main event that is to vote the design of mock up from 2 competitor between Azzam and Faris.

391
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:18,670
Rudi: Okay the first voters. Before of that this vote is including the reasons why you choose that design.

392
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,070
Rudi: Ok from the first time is Daffa. Please Daffa.

393
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,050
Daffa: Between Azzam and Faris yeah.

394
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:47,330
Daffa: Actually for used apps, I like a simple design because I'm a minimalist.

395
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:54,690
Daffa: So I prefer minimalism that have a simple design but many uses for user.

396
00:34:55,370 --> 00:35:06,870
Daffa: Although Faris's design is minimalist but for...

397
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,570
Farhan: Complexity?

398
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:18,150
Daffa: not complexity, I mean illustrate user interface of Faris's design is less than Azzam's design.

399
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:37,050
Daffa: I more prefer of Azam's illustrate user interface design where he used color palette and make the application so pleasing to the eye.

400
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:44,770
Daffa: Therefor I prefer to vote Faris's design.

401
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,450
Daffa: Because I'm a minimalist. So I prefer the minimalism design.

402
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:54,250
Rudi: Okay vote for Faris. For the second voters is Akbar. It seems like Akbar wants to speak first.

403
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,450
Akbar: Ok I want to vote.

404
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,030
Rudi: Ok please Akbar *Akbar Laughing*

405
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,390
Akbar: Ok without saying too much guys directly to main discuss.

406
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:05,110
All: Let us know Akbar.

407
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:13,030
Akbar: Actually I think both of design is good enough

408
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:24,590
Akbar: but for Azzam's design I think it displayed an interface which is more interesting to look up

409
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:36,170
Akbar: and also color combination, as a function I prefer to Azzam's design. So I vote to Azzam.

410
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:45,510
Rudi: Ok it means draw between Daffa and Akbar. Daffa vote Faris and Akbar vote Azzam. OK OK.

411
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:55,210
Rudi: Next to third voters to vote there is Adi first. Please Adi.

412
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:56,710
Adi: OK.

413
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:12,370
Adi: In My opinion, for the design I prefer to Azzam

414
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:18,510
Adi: because the color is more pleasing to the eye, but for the feature I prefer to Faris

415
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,710
Adi: because there are not too much.

416
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:30,630
Adi: For Azzam's design is good and much features but maybe useless so it is like wasting place.

417
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:37,610
Adi: But for the design and color selection I prefer Azzam.

418
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:44,490
Adi: So I vote Faris because more minimalistic. Not many features are wasted.

419
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:48,430
Rudi: Ok it means Faris's score is 2 and for Azzam's score is 1.

420
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:52,790
Rudi: Ok for the fourth voters is Ridho first.

421
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,970
Ridho: Ok First for Azzam's design I think my answer is the same with Akbar earlier.

422
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:06,030
Rudi: The color palette is good then more variable so more pleasing to the eye.

423
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:15,210
Ridho: For Faris's design is more simple than Azzam's design and there are menus that has well function.

424
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:21,370
How much better for Faris's design is collaborated with Azzam's design.

425
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:26,610
Ridho: So color palette from Azzam's design and for the simple design is from Faris's design.

426
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,110
Ridho: So I vote to Azzam.

427
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,590
Farhan: Ok it means the last voters to result a final score.

428
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,950
He said....

429
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,150
Ridho: Thank You.

430
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,870
Rudi: You're welcome dho..

431
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,230
Rudi: He said....

432
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,030
Farhan: Ok I want to see home interface from Azzam's design first.

433
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,090
*Ridho Laughing*

434
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,370
*Clashing Sound*

435
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:51,570
*Talking Gibberish*

436
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,770
Rudi: Farhan you are the last voters to result this score.

437
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:06,690
Azzam: This is. This is the home interface for my design.

438
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,650
Azzam: Is it necessary to explain?

439
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:12,930
Farhan: No, wait.

440
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:19,190
Farhan: I was left the section of functions letter earlier

441
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:27,610
Farhan: but as far as I can see from Azzam's an Faris's design is true that Faris's design is more minimalistic than Azzam's design

442
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:33,430
Farhan: but I think Faris's and Azzam's design is like Instagram and Facebook features.

443
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:42,710
Farhan: If we can see in Instagram features there is not have copy menus, but there is only have delete menu If I am not mistaken, when we want to select comment.

444
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:48,030
Farhan: This is just for example. It means the features are simple and not that much.

445
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:56,670
