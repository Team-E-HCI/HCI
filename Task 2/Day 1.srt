00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,120
All: Assalamu'alaikum warrahmatullahi wabarakatuh

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:23,440
Rudi: Hello guys, we're from E Team of Human Computer Interaction course! On the right-side corner is our Captain, Faris^^

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:33,320
Rudi: Tonight we're gonna discuss about a mobile app which we should be able to improve it.

4
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,640
Rudi: After a couple of days we used the mobile apps,

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,320
Rudi: So how's your respond, Faris?
(Oh by the way, the mobile apps we talked about is Tell.)

6
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:51,800
Faris: Well, IMO, it's my first time using this concept of a mobile app,

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,880
Faris: The concept is quite interesting

8
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:05,560
Faris: We can write stories as an anonymous and we didn't know about "who post what" because of the anonymous concept.

9
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:14,360
Faris: So, the concept is quite interesting. But, i think because Tell is still "new" so the UI needs to be improve

10
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,090
Rudi: How about you, Azzam?

11
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,320
Azzam: Tell has two features, Fun Corner and Stories. And in Stories, we can write as an anonym and posted it online,

12
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:50,200
Azzam: so i think it's a good feature where we can improve our writing skills. It's really a good idea.

13
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:59,640
Azzam: In Fun Corner, we can write anything we want without people knowing our identity.

14
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,320
Azzam: That's it.

15
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:09,120
Rudi: Okay, that's it from Azzam. It's my turn to give opinion, but for the record I used Tell only for few days,

16
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,060
Rudi: The good point about Tell is we can freely sharing (i.e. stories, confide etc) anything,

17
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,380
Rudi: And every people who used Tell will read it,

18
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,960
Rudi: Let's say there's person who shares their bad experience about something, then the other user who read it will be able to anticipated it.

19
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,480
Rudi: then the other user who read it will be able to anticipated it. That's my 1st opinion.

20
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Rudi: My 2nd opinion, like Faris said,

21
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,680
Rudi: Tell is a place where we can share stories or messages without people knowing our identity.

22
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:39,560
Rudi: So we can freely tell everyone about anything including our bad or embarassing stories without fear.

23
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,680
Rudi: What can we improve about Tell?

24
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,820
Rudi: What is your opinion, Faris?

25
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,000
Faris: There's a lot. Wow, i sound so arrogant:(
Rudi: Spill it.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Faris: *laugh*

27
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:13,640
Faris: Because Tell is quite new, so the UI need to be improve because it's not visually appealing.

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,600
Faris: And some of interaction parts is less efficient.

29
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,680
Rudi: Can you be more spesific?

30
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
Rudi : *gibberish*

31
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:44,560
Rudi: Can you describe it in objective pov? Excluding the subjective pov (i.e. personal taste of color, etc etc)

32
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,200
Faris: On the dashboard page, there's menus for Fun Corner and Stories.

33
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,720
Faris: The illustration right above those menus is quite too big

34
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,080
Faris: So the user's first sight is the illustration, but IMO, those menus should be the user's first sight when they open the app.

35
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,830
Rudi: Do you mean that those menus should be the hightlight of the dashboard page?

36
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,830
Faris: Yes

37
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,480
Faris: And there's bug in the comment section of Stories,

38
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,800
Faris: When the comment section is empty, the notification that says "be the first one bla bla" is crushed into the comment box where we type our comment

39
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,030
Rudi & Faris: *clarifies*

40
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,880
Faris: That's it from me. Maybe Azzam wanna give his opinion about the app?

41
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,680
Rudi: Now your turn, Azzam.

42
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,870
Azzam: Here's the dashboard page.

43
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,400
Azzam: So this is the illustration that Faris talked about.

44
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,520
Azzam: Here's my opinion about what needs to be improve for Tell

45
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:25,320
Azzam: If we clicked the Stories menu button, it brings us to this page. The Profile menu located here,

46
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:31,680
Azzam: But, IMO, Profile page usually located either on Dashboard page or Settings page,

47
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,760
Azzam: So it's a bit weird for me to see Profile page on Stories. This needs to be improve.

48
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,680
Azzam: Another things that needs to be improved, if we look at the Stories page, there's Categories.

49
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Azzam: And, there's Latest Stories right below the Categories.

50
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,400
Azzam: IMO, the Latest Stories should be placed inside the Categories. Let's take Love Life category as an example.

51
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,880
Azzam: Love Life should have two tabs-menu, such as Most Views and Latest Stories.

52
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,360
Azzam: Because, if the Latest Stories placed outside and right below the Categories, we didn't know what the genre of the story is.

53
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,400
Azzam: Let's take "Dear Mas" as an example. What if Dear Mas's genre turned out to be Horror?

54
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,190
(It's gonna be a big problem bcs, in user there must be one person who HATES horror.)

55
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,760
Azzam: So, we didn't know the genre of the Stories listed in the Lates Stories.

56
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,640
Rudi: Ah, so the unknown genre is gonna bring problem.

57
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,560
Azzam: Yes.

58
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,360
Azzam: And if we take a look at Fun Corner page,

59
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,160
Azzam: there's "Arts" as one of the categories. But, if we tapped Arts,

60
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:35,000
Azzam: The Users often posted about music and movies, so i think those two can be separated into new categories.

61
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:45,400
Azzam: So it's either added two new categories or replace Arts with Music and Movies categories.

62
00:06:45,940 --> 00:07:01,080
Azzam: Ah, this is what Faris talked about, when the comment section is empty, the notification line crashed into the comment box.

63
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,040
Azzam: I think the cat bowl size should be reduced in order to lift up the notification line.

64
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,280
Azzam: So that's how to solved this problem.

65
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,120
Faris: But IMO, it's kinda useless to tell the user that the comment section is empty...

66
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,930
Rudi: I agree, it's better left the comment section blank to avoid the problem.

67
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,280
Faris: Yes that's true, no need to insert notification line.

68
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,680
Faris: Why the user need to know that the comment section is empy when they can see it with their own eyes?
Rudi: OR OR OR OR

69
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,160
Rudi: Or, remove the cat bowl pic so there's only the notification line on the empty comment section.

70
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:41,400
Azzam: Ah that's true, because here besides the bubble chat icon, there's an indicator number of how many people comment on this stories.

71
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,000
Azzam: Let's continue. So this is how it looks when we click into Education category in Fun Stories (I got mixed up between Fun Corner and Stories:( )

72
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,640
Azzam: Oops, I mean Fun Corner.

73
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,000
Azzam: So this is the timeline of Education category, as you can see that this is obviously anonymus.

74
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,600
Faris: FYI, it looks like this on every categories in Fun Corner.

75
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,960
Azzam: Yes that's true.

76
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,640
Azzam: For me, the UI is not too visually appealing.

77
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,320
Faris: Look at those bubble chat...

78
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,570
Azzam & Rudi: Yes, the bubble chat is quite unsightly.

79
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:18,240
Azzam: It just my subjective pov but I think it's not gonna make the user spend a long time here.

80
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,800
Rudi: Too basic, plain and standard

81
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,560
Azzam: So I think this page still can be improve.

82
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,240
Azzam: That's it from me.

83
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,520
Faris: I found another things that this app need to improve. Can I talk about it?

84
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Azzam & Rudi: Spill it.

85
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,110
Faris: Do you guys see the orange-colored rounded thing right below theEducation tab?

86
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,250
Azzam: Ah yes, I saw it.

87
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,440
Faris: I think that's the notification bar, because it tells us about the upcoming iOS version of this app. IMO,

88
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,250
Faris: the notification bar should placed on the Dashboard page,

89
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,640
Rudi & Azzam: I think you're right.

90
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,600
Rudi: Because it easier for people to see it and it definitely gonna be seen by every user.

91
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,960
Azzam: Yes you're right

92
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,480
Azzam: Ah! I remember something, there's another thing that this app needs to be improve.

93
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,280
Azzam: I once posted at Fun Corner on Education categories, here you can look at my post that says "Fun main bla bla bla"

94
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,320
Faris: So it's true that you're the one who posted it?

95
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Azzam: Yes, that's me

96
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Faris: *laugh*

97
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,960
Azzam: The last time I checked, I found out that there's users who commented under my post. But, I didn't receive any notification

98
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,840
Azzam: So I didn't know that about the comments under my post.

99
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,840
Azzam: *talks gibberish*

100
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:37,480
Azzam: So I think this need to be improve

101
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,840
Rudi: Do you mean the "push to notification" feature?

102
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,960
Azzam: Well, yes, but what I mean is this notification icon.

103
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:01,680
Azzam: There's no sign that my post got commented on this notification icon

104
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,840
Azzam: So I think this needs to be improve too

105
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:17,520
Azzam: Because the notification icon should tell us when our post got likes or comments

106
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,520
Azzam: That's it from me.

107
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,680
Rudi: Well because my opinion is the same as my friends's, I don't have to repeat it again, right? *laugh*

108
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,960
Rudi: *gibberish*

109
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:38,760
Rudi: Is there anything you guys want to add? About things that needs to be improved from Tell?

110
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,250
Rudi: Anyone?

111
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:54,520
Faris: Hm...maybe Tell should add checkbox on their Dialogue Box that pop-up everytime we open the apps that asked us to grant permission to run in background.

112
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:02,560
Faris: Checkbox that says "Do not show this message again". Because, if you didn't give permission,

113
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,160
Faris:  the Dialogue Box keeps pop-up endlessly,

114
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,000
Faris: so it's kinda annoying

115
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:18,840
Rudi: Okay, Faris addition is Tell needs to add checkbox to avoid user getting annoyed

116
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,600
Faris & Rudi: *keep repeating the same thing again...*

117
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,320
Rudi: Okay, so we're gonna do this "challenge" (i.e. assignment)

118
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,720
Rudi: and we're gonna follow the Google Design Sprint method step-by-step,

119
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,480
Rudi: In the 1st day, we started by discussion about the mobile apps and recorded by Zoom Meeting Cloud,

120
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,400
Rudi: and on the 2nd day, we're gonna design our own UI based on "things need to be improve from the mobile app",

121
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,520
Rudi: and then we're gonna ask another Team to vote which design is the best among us,

122
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,800
Rudi: Is 2 days is enough for you guys to finish the design?

123
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,690
Rudi: Is it enough?

124
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,880
Azzam: Yes
Faris: Yes that's enough
Azzam: I'll try my best

125
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,920
Rudi: Well, the designers on our Team is Faris and Azzam, My role is just back up lol

126
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,920
Rudi: As for the 3rd days,

127
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,520
Rudi: I forgot to mention, the 1st day in our "Google Design Sprint calendar" is October 5th, 2020.

128
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:24,160
Rudi: And the designing process takes 2 days,

129
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,720
Rudi: on October 6th to October 7th, 2020.

130
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:32,240
Rudi: and then we're gonna hold a voting event to choose the best design among us

131
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,080
Rudi: on October 8th, 2020.

132
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,600
Rudi: On the next day, (October 9th, 2020),

133
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:52,160
Rudi: We're gonna presenting our improve design and discuss about it with the Tell developer team.

134
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,200
Rudi: *repeat the same line again*

135
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,480
Rudi: whether they acknowledge our own UI or not, it's not a big deal.
Faris: We only need their feedback

136
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,280
Azzam: I really wish we can do our schedule on October 9th

137
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,360
Rudi: I think that's enough for today's discussion.

138
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,640
Rudi: Is there anything you guys want to add?

139
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,160
Faris: *asking himself*
