00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:13,040

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:27,960
Rudi: In this night we will have a meeting for the result of design after we voted earlier with passerby from other group.

00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:39,280
Rudi: Okay. I want to ask permission to recording this discussion for proofing that we have submitted our design results.

4
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:50,100
Rudi: After we vote from the Faris's and Azzam's design, the result of the vote were chose the Azzam's design.

5
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,980
Rudi: Before we next to main discuss maybe there is something to say from faris? Please faris.

6
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,880
Faris: What is that, Rud? *Laughing*

7
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,260
Rudi: Before that, we want to introduce ourself. My name is Rudiansyah Wijaya Pratama.

Mr. Hudya: Good. Good.

10
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,500
Rudi: Our leader. If you have something to say.

11
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,800
Faris: Do you hear me?

12
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,880
Rudi: Yes, I can hear you.

13
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:43,800
Faris: Maybe as group leader I want to say thanks for Mr.Hudya and Teams Who has taken your time to attend this meeting tonight.

14
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:53,380
Faris: So suddenly contacted you to ask for critic your design.

15
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,380
Faris: Like unpleasant

16
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,380
Mr. Hudya: Ok

17
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:03,480
Faris: Yes maybe I just wanna say thanks and I want to apologize if there are words that are not pleasant to hear.

18
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,420
Mr. Hudya: Calm calm.

19
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:18,140
Faris: Then also a little bit tells that the tasks is to implement the google design sprint.

20
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,600
Faris: For the example for the first day we must decide the design will look like.

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:33,400
Faris: Then for the second day actually for two days the second and the third day is for designing mockup, yesterday is vote the best design

22
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:44,700
Faris: and this is the last day which is the fourth day is for presented our design to user where the user in this task is the developer app.

23
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,660
Faris: Approxiately like that.

24
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:55,820
Rudi: Ok just go ahead without talk too much. Please Azzam to presentate the design.

25
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,640
Azzam: Well before that I want to say good evening let me introduce myself, my name is Abdullah Azzam.

26
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:15,200
Azzam: So I want to start, actually it's just knowledegeable analysis from me because I don't have basic design at all.

27
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,660
Azzam: So I made this design pure of subjectively from me.

28
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,540
Mr. Hudya: Ok no problem.

29
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:23,560
Azzam: Please allow me to share screen.
Mr. Hudya: Ok no problem.

30
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,760
Azzam: Please allow me to share screen.

31
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,740
Rudi: Ok Ok

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:35,400
Azzam: Well can I get started. So if we open the "Tell" application will display homepage like this.

33
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:45,440
Azzam: So if we open the "Tell" application will display homepage like this. in this homepage there are people illustration, notification button, fun corner menu, stories menu, home button, and chatting button.

34
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:59,480
Azzam: In my opinion, in homepage there is bubble chat logo. I think this bubble chat logo is shortcut to enter the fun corner's room.

35
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:08,160
Azzam: Because fun corner's room have a bubble speech logo and this is too. So I think this is shortcut feature.

36
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:17,140
Azzam: But when I pressed this button, *searching photos*  it turned out to be in the chat room instead.

37
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:27,860
Azzam: So in my point of view, maybe between the chat room button or fun corner logo must be changed. So that user can't be missconcepsion about this bubble chat icon.

38
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:40,240
Azzam: So users can distinguish icon between fun corner room and private chat room or the fun corner icon can be changed or conversly. Like that for my point of view.

39
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,740
Mr. Hudya: Ok.
Azzam: So users are not misunderstand.

40
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:51,460
Azzam: Then for illustration, there is 2 people who are chatting with other people.

41
00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:01,680
Azzam: In my opinion, literally from my opinion the illustration is too big.

42
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:14,780
Azzam: Because mostly in homepage application, *Freezing* the feature like fun corner and stories must be highlighted.

43
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:27,300
Azzam: But the illustration looks more dominating. So the fun corner room and stories is located under the illustration. So it is like the second side and it doesn't look like a first side for users.

44
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:38,760
Azzam: I mean the illustrator is the first side and that menus like the second side. So this should be the fitting drift *Freezing*   Mr. Hudya: Okay Interesting.   Azzam: first side for user when saw the homepage.

45
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:47,340
Azzam: Actually I have been made the improve design literally my improve design. For the origin immprove...
Azzam: where it is? Ah it is.

46
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:58,220
Azzam: So as I said earlier this is for replacing an icon bubble chat for chat feature sir.

47
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:05,760
Azzam: So users know that this icon for chat, for mail and users are not misunderstanding as before.

48
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:06,960
Mr. Hudya: Ok.

49
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:17,940
Azzam: Then I added in homepage, a feature as I said before on the homepage it should explain the contents of application to make it more interesting.

50
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:31,000
Azzam: Therefor in this section I added feature popular on stories so users know the popular stories that are often read by other users.

51
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:41,680
Azzam: So for other user when they just entered the application an see the homepage, they are curious with stories which have tittle interesting for read.

52
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:53,060
Azzam: For example there is story with tittle "Semester 5 is hell" and accidential users also in semester 5, maybe he think the story is relate so users want to read that story in this popular stories.

53
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,820
Azzam: So it can attracts the user curiousity.

54
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:12,960
Azzam: Then in "Tells" application also fun corner feature, it likens simple version of stories like we send something, ask something, and write something anonymously but a simple version of stories sir.

55
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:28,520
Azzam: So I purposely made this like trending on fun corner actually the concept is same with popular on stories just because the contents are less than stories, so I only fill this with the main content.

56
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:40,280
For example there is main post like "Kotlin vs Java" and there is main post like "Circle Tofu team or Circle Earth team" so that users are interesting for discuss the topic.

57
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:52,700
Azzam: Like for example there are users that kotlin user and he think kotlin is better than than java so they can pressed that topic and he can join the discussion then chatting with other users.

58
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,880
Azzam: Therefor I made like this.

59
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:05,780
Azzam: Then as alternative for fun corner and stories menus as I said that fun corner and stories must be first side for users.

60
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:18,140
Azzam: Well I created electronic banner like this and I inspirated from Shopee application because in shopee there is an electronic banner for attracted user attention.

61
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:25,220
Azzam: If we pressed, we will be taken to page from that banner.

62
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,020
Azzam: So it is just for menu replacement.

63
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:41,080
Azzam: Besides for the first side, it can be taken user to enter the room just for pressed the banner. So it can be efficient.

64
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,740
Mr. Hudya: Hmm okay.

65
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:56,160
Azzam: and then I added dropdow menu in this place. The contents of dropdown menu are my profile, my post, my stories, my bookmark, and my library.

66
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:13,420
Azzam: Why I add this? Because for the example this my profile in "Tell" application we must entered stories room before. We entered stories, then in stories there is my profile.

67
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:26,740
Azzam: In my opinion why not put it homepage together. So users can accessed easily.

68
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:37,820
They just pressed the dropdown menu and there is my profile and they can access their profile. So they don't have to enter stories room earlier to access my profile.

69
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:56,920
Azzam: This my posts feature is for posts that users have been sent at fun corner. So if we pressed my posts button, the users can see their posts who has made before in fun corner.

70
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:16,360
Azzam: The purpose is for example user have been wrote very cringe post 5 months ago, when he open that post and he already repetance they want to change or delete that post.

71
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,740
Well than he should entered to fun corner room and choose a category then users must scrooled down untill they found their stories,

72
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:34,120
Azzam: better the button dropped here to make it easy when users want to changed their posts. They just going to my post and they can find their post.

73
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:47,260
Azzam: Actually my stories feature not too much different with my stories feature which exists in my profile like the users can find out that users has written something.

74
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:59,020
Azzam: and it is not too much different with my bookmarks with purpose to make it easy so it dropped to dropdown menu in homepage in my opinion.

75
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:21,920
Azzam: Well for my library, the purpose is to users that want to read a long story and that user doesn't have much time to read that story,

76
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:32,580
Azzam: and when he have time but evidently the stories are pile up so he will be in trouble for scrolling the stories.

77
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:46,460
Azzam: Therefor I made my library  for users know the stories he has read before. If they want to read stories they had not finished yet, he can pressed my library feature in their homepage. Like that.

78
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,660
Mr. Hudya: Ok.

79
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,640
Azzam: and then we entered fun corner menu.

80
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:11,060
Azzam: If we pressed my corner button from homepage, it will display several categories in fun corner.

81
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:25,140
Azzam: Well in my opinion, There is sofa icon which symbolizes zone where we can chatting and share story in fun corner.

82
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:36,460
Azzam: But in my opinion it should be oppacity of sofa icon don't be lowered because it is like the icon merges with the background.

83
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:53,040
Azzam: Maybe for some people who they don't have low visualization, I mean they can't see, but they have little problem with their visualization like for example minus or etc so to see the icon maybe will have trouble.

84
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:02,320
Azzam: So I think to make this icon must be span out like this so it is like doesn't blend with the background and users know that this shape is like sofa icon.

85
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:16,220
Azzam: and then there is arts menu in fun corner categories.

86
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:43,020
Azzam: But when I pressed *Freezing* art menu, there are music topic like for newest discuss a lyric of song, discuss a podcast. So it is like a song topic, and then who actually discuss art topic is just a little bit.

87
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:56,130
Azzam: Therefor than maybe users that disucss about arts topic are not much, better to broken down arts topic to music categories.

88
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:06,470
Azzam: So users who want to posts about music topics can entered music room, and I added 4 other categories there are movie, confession, and book.

89
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:17,380
Azzam: Well music and movie are the result of broken down from arts. So than the users only discuss about both of this topic and they don't discuss arts topic,

90
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:24,300
Azzam: better for arts is erased and replaced with music and movie so that categories can be usefull.

91
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:38,620
Azzam: So than we entered arts topic but the topic discussion is discussed for 30 days ago and 10 days ago until rarely, better *Freezing* created a separate category.

92
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:53,300
Azzam: Then for the confession this is I inspirated from confession bear spongebob because in fun corner the users can write, ask, can do anything as anonymous person.

93
00:14:53,300 --> 00:15:02,060
Azzam: Therefor in this confession room we can confessed anything like confessed romance, confessed the shameful things.

94
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:11,120
Azzam: Like for example I can confess that long time ago I have been bridgewalk from Jakarta to Bandung or else that has been done before.

95
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:21,280
and the main idea is to make a focus confession, because I worry that in lounge will fulfilled with confess.

96
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:28,280
Azzam: Supposed th Lounge drawned by the Confess, I think the Confess should be the focused one

97
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Azzam: So people can be like, "Oh I want to confess this, I want to confess that."

98
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Azzam: And the Book is actually Art's fraction, so if people want to read book there'll be much recomendation

99
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:53,280
Azzam: And now about Fun Corner timeline, for example we use Art category

100
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Azzam: This is an information, right? It said that Tell want to be updated

101
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Azzam: And before there's also information about Tell will be available on IOS

102
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Azzam: So this is like a news about Tell, right...

103
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Azzam: But if it's put here, I think like something wrong, and the information is too big

104
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Azzam: And that's why in the Home I made an electronic banner, like Carousel

105
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Azzam: This was made so can be used to put information like that

106
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Azzam: Like "Tell want to be updated, please submit the questionaire so Tell can be better."

107
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Azzam: So it won't take much space in Fun Corner

108
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Azzam: And that's from my point of view

109
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Azzam: And another point of view of mine is about the timeline, there are some spaces on the right side

110
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Azzam: I think if there's a space on the one side, so on the other side must be a space too, I think that's more comfortable to see

111
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Azzam: So the solutions are add some spaces too on the other side, or just delete them all

112
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Azzam: And this is my idea about Fun Corner timeline

113
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Azzam: Like I said before if there's a space on the one side, so on the other side must be a space too, so it's more comfortable to see

114
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Azzam: So don't put that spaces only on one side

115
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Azzam: Or just stick both sides to the border

116
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Azzam: Actually my design insipred from group chat

117
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Azzam: The purpose is I want the users feel comfortable and safe to send anonymous post

118
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Azzam: Like in a group chat, we feel safe because in that group there only our closest person

119
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:08,280
Azzam: So we'll feel safe to post everything

120
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Azzam: That's why I made the display like this so the users will feel like chatting with their friends

121
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Azzam: Although if we post something terrible, but the users will feel more comfortable, that's why I made it like this

122
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Azzam: And I also add Popular and Recent features

123
00:19:43,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Azzam: So for example like in Recent, the users now will know what is other users listen now

124
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Azzam: So like, "Oh user C is covering this song, user B have released this song."

125
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:18,280
Azzam: So the users will know new update in that category

126
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:33,280
Azzam: And for the Popular, suppose there're posts about "Avenged Sevenfold recommended songs" or "BTS reccomended songs"

127
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Azzam: Usually posts like that will be a lot of loves and replies

128
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Azzam: So the users will know what is popular in that category

129
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Azzam: And if like this, the users just have to click Popular tab and click the post

130
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Azzam: So like if they're searching for recommended song, they just go to Popular, that's my idea

131
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,280
Azzam: And I also add Search feature

132
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:33,280
Azzam: Before there's no Search feature, I add the Search Feature, why?

133
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Azzam: For example in Music Category, and suppose Tell users have reach 10 million, so the update will be very fast

134
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:57,280
Azzam: So for example the users want to know Taylor Swift recommended songs

135
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:05,280
Azzam: But they can't find it in Popular and Recent because the fast update

136
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Azzam: That's why I add Seacrh so users will easily find post they want to read, they only have to search it

137
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Azzam: And if the users searching, the post will surely appear

138
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Azzam: Oh this is Taylor Swift's recomended songs

139
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Azzam: And they just have to read the comments

140
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Azzam: Oh this is Taylor Swift's recomended song, Back to December

141
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,280
Azzam: They just have to love or screenshot the post

142
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Azzam: They also can add to their bookmark, so if they want to read again in the other time they can open it again

143
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,280
Azzam: They know what song that they want to hear

144
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Azzam: Ok, now to this display

145
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Azzam: If we click a post in Fun Corner

146
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Azzam: In the right side there are some space, back to my comment earlier

147
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,280
Azzam: If we want put some space on the right, we have to put on the left too

148
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Azzam: Or just delete them all like the one I created

149
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Azzam: Earlier, I made the chat bubble with some spaces on the right and left side

150
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:29,280
Azzam: But when clicked, I made it full 'cause I think it's more visually appealing

151
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,280
Azzam: If we don't want to have some spaces just delete them all, but if we want, we must put it on the right and left side

152
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
Azzam: And then to the stories

153
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:48,280
Azzam: Oh I forgot, I think there is a bug in fun corner

154
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Azzam: I have made this post before, "fun main() ", the kotlin one

155
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Azzam: But when I checked it again...

156
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,280
Azzam: I created the post 5 days ago

157
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Azzam: When I checked again, apparently there are 6 replies, but...

158
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Azzam: There is nothing in my notification

159
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,280
Azzam: The notificiation is empty

160
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,280
Azzam: So I think that's probably a bug

161
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:28,280
Azzam: The flaw is there, "Oh there is a reply", earlier I guess there was no reply, but there it is

162
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,280
Azzam: Ok now aboout The Stories

163
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,280
Azzam: When we click stories the dsiplay turned to this

164
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,280
Azzam: There are stories, categories, and latest stories

165
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:48,280
Azzam: In my opinion this is..., it's just my knowledgeably opinion

166
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
Azzam: Before in Fun Corner

167
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Azzam: The menu is like this, when clicked there are some categories

168
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Azzam: But why when we click stories, the categories are here? And there are latest stories here?

169
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Azzam: In my point of view, why not when we click stories appear some categories too like in fun corner, and then...

170
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Azzam: The "Latest Stories" is in the category, like this

171
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,280
Azzam: So when we click stories, the display is like the one in fun corner

172
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:35,280
Azzam: Only the background is made differently, like in here the background is different to identify each other

173
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Azzam: For example, "Oh the pink one is stories about romance, the green one is about school."

174
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Azzam: It's just the same, actually I just made it so that the categories appear immediately

175
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Azzam: And when we click a category, the posts appear

176
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,280
Azzam: What are the stories that have been sent by others, and the latest stories will go to recent tab

177
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,280
Azzam: And there is also popular tab, like 'what is the story with the most feedbacks

178
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Azzam: And in the recent tab we could know what is the newest posted story

179
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:24,280
Azzam: For example, if we click on "Love Life", then the stories will appear like this

180
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Azzam: Well, for example if we click on a story, then the display will be like this

181
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Azzam: For example the "Dear, Mas" story, if clicked the display will be like this

182
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Azzam: Actually, my comment is just the same, if on the left side there are some spaces, then on the other side there must some spaces too

183
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:49,280
Azzam: But this is a story, if we add spaces on both sides, the text will shrink to the center, so it doesn't seem good

184
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,280
Azzam: So it's better if in the stories, the display is made full

185
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Azzam: And if the post not commented yet, the "the story doesn't have any comments" text is overflow to the comment box

186
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:13,280
Azzam: So probably this is a flaw, I think the catbowl image can be shrinked

187
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Azzam: And there is a dropdown arrow, if we click that the full story is just appeared

188
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:32,280
Azzam: The content of the story is just appeared, in my point of view, why don't immidately appear like this

189
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Azzam: So for example a user click on stories, "oh the title is interesting, 'Dear, Mantan' I want to read it"

190
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:46,280
Azzam: And when clicked, the whole story is immidiately appear, this is the title and this is the content

191
00:27:46,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Azzam: So like the user must not click the title and the dropdown arrow, it's better after we click the title we immidiately moved to this page

192
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
Azzam: Just like that

193
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Azzam: And this is the share feature

194
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Azzam: In the stories before, where is it...

195
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Azzam: Here it is

196
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:27,280
Azzam: If we click the three dots, there are just 'report story' and 'bookmark'

197
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:36,280
Azzam: What if the story is very interesting and very good, but we cannot share that, therefore I add the share feature

198
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Azzam: So here I add a feature so we can share a story and other people can read it too

199
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:57,280
Azzam: So like "You know 'Dear, Mantan' story on Tell is pretty interesting, you must read it too", so other people can be interested to download Tell and read this story

200
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Azzam: Oh here is the display when there is no comment

201
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,280
Azzam: And here the comment section of this post

202
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:17,280
Azzam: I separate the comment section from the story, to minimize something like this

203
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Azzam: Like the overflowed text here, to overcome this we can minimize the text or made the comment section separately like this

204
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
Azzam: So there are just comments here

205
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:36,280
Azzam: So that the text doesn't overflowed and it's more focused that this is for comment, and this is the post

206
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:45,280
Azzam: So if the comment section is separated, if the post is not commented yet there just an empty space

207
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,280
Azzam: We know immidiately "Oh no one here yet" and back to the post

208
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Azzam: Or probably we want to comment to be the first comment, so this text doesn't overflow to the comment box

209
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,280
Azzam: Oh and this is a post that have 'show more' in it

210
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Azzam: The content is "Is there someone that want to help me blablabla blablabla" and this is a fun corner post

211
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,280
Azzam: In the one of the category in fun corner

212
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,280
Azzam: But there is a show more here, apparently when it's clicked the content is just the same
Mr. Hudya: There is nothing

213
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,280
Azzam: Yes, the content is just the same
Mr. Hudya: I know

214
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Azzam: There might be a bug and probably can be improved

215
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Mr. Hudya: That is exactly a bug, there's no way it's fine

216
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:46,280
Azzam: I think that's it the knowledgeably analysis from me the one that doesn't have design basics

217
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Mr. Hudya: Ok, it's interesting

218
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
Azzam: And thank you

219
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Azzam: I might can have feedbacks from Mr. Hudya and team about my analysis so that I can be improved too

220
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,280
Mr. Hudya: Ok guys I'll be the first one because I fried the takoyaki not cooked enough

221
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,280
Mr. Hudya: Ok about the dashboard, I dont' comment it in terms of UI/UX

222
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,280
Mr. Hudya: There some other thing that I want to "touch"

223
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Mr. Hudya: The first thing is in terms of the dashboard, actually we have three versions of Tell

224
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Mr. Hudya: From version 1, 2, and 3, if you asked our old users

225
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Mr. Hudya: We have version one, two, three, and actually we are in state of A/B test

226
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,280
Mr. Hudya: From the first to third version which one is the most beautiful dashboard?

227
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,280
Mr. Hudya: And that's why in the first version we made it this way, in the second version we made it this way, and in the third version we made it big like that

228
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Mr. Hudya: One of them is we are also pursuing the approach of what can we do with the dashboard

229
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,280
Mr. Hudya: So I also target it in terms of business, not overall is about UI

230
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,280
Mr. Hudya: Bu I also understand that some of UI must be considered

231
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Mr. Hudya: That's why I said we are in state of A/B test

232
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Mr. Hudya: And the reason we make the questionnaire is to check how far the flaw is

233
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:14,280
Mr. Hudya: Ok about the problem that the category is too general, I want to give an overview

234
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Mr. Hudya: Earlier you mentioned about arts, right? Actually when I make the categories I have personal thoughts too, why?

235
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:30,280
Mr. Hudya: Because in terms of myself, I understand the behavior of my users

236
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Mr. Hudya: That's why, I also have some feedbacks, they say "it's better music and movie don't be combined", why?

237
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Mr. Hudya: Because if arts not necessarily have a lot of users, moreover music and movie

238
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,280
Mr. Hudya: So that's why we minimize the scope to a totally general one

239
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Mr. Hudya: So if talked about art wether it's music, wether it's painting, or anything, we put in "Art" category

240
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Mr. Hudya: So that's why I don't separate it to art, movie, in fact we have plan to make mental health

241
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Mr. Hudya: But we still looking how engaged users to that category

242
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Mr. Hudya: So we haven't dared to separate generally

243
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,280
Mr. Hudya: I also still looking the behavior, that's why we don't separate all of them

244
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:25,280
Mr. Hudya: And we direct them to Lounge so that's why we put Lounge up there, so if they want OOT just use the Lounge

245
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Mr. Hudya: And then the second thing about the Announcement that is too big

246
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Mr. Hudya: Actually the Announcement in each category can be changed

247
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,280
Mr. Hudya: So if art the Announcement is like this, education is like this

248
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:49,280
Mr. Hudya: So that's why in A/B test we had a time doing a paid promote

249
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:56,280
Mr. Hudya: Apparently some of the users think that the Announcement is unique, why?

250
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:05,280
Mr. Hudya: Because for example I am paid promoting an item, in Arts and in Education how the ads is written is different but still related

251
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:14,280
Mr. Hudya: For example I am paid promoting an item that not related to education, but I made it like that's related

252
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Mr. Hudya: Actually we want to know would they click it, how engaged they click it

253
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Mr. Hudya: So that's why we made it like that, so we can customize it for soft selling and content purpose

254
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Mr. Hudya: And back again we still in state of A/B test

255
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Mr. Hudya: And then the third thing about the timeline design, earlier you mentioned that the box not balanced on both side

256
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Mr. Hudya: Actually this design inspired by on of the design from Dribble

257
00:34:50,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Mr. Hudya: And actually we still in A/B test, we've been made it looks like twitter, and we even changed it to swipe mode, and lastly we made it like this

258
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Mr. Hudya: And the first impression of some users especially a woman, they said the design is very cute

259
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Mr. Hudya: We are still in A/B test, and now I understand that design like this is cute

260
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Mr. Hudya: Although I also understand in terms of UI/UX is not quite right

261
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Mr. Hudya: But let's improve again, because we are still a startup

262
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:31,280
Mr. Hudya: And that's why the right side is sticking to the border, and on the left side we add some spaces for time label

263
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Mr. Hudya: But I want to thank you for friends from UNJ for the awareness

264
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Mr. Hudya: And I still discuss with UI/UX team which is the best timeline, so that's why we throw a questionnaire so we can make it better in the next version

265
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,280
Mr. Hudya: And then about Popular and Recent, actually we've done that in Tell 1

266
00:35:52,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Mr. Hudya: But it's not in the current version because we still search the best approach cause it's still category based

267
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,280
Mr. Hudya: So don't let the Recent or Popular is from 30 days ago, I think that's too bad

268
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Mr. Hudya: Cause earlier we've made the timeline like Twitter, the Popular is pretty quick cause they're still in one category and stacking each other

269
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Mr. Hudya: So why we still don't make the Popular and Recent, because we still don't know the best approach, and we currently working for IOS version that made the general development slower

270
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Mr. Hudya: And then about why we dont' display the whole story immidately

271
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,280
Mr. Hudya: In stories that you mentioned why don't the whole story appear immidately

272
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,280
Mr. Hudya: The answer is just the same, we're still in state of A/B test

273
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:53,280
Mr. Hudya: And I've had time take reference from Wattpad, from some design in Dribble

274
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,280
Mr. Hudya: And there is a design like this, and I think that will be interesting to try it

275
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,280
Mr. Hudya: But I also understand it's quite bad technichally

276
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Mr. Hudya: But cause my CTO is very kind person, he help me to achieve my dream, so that's why we created it like this

277
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,280
Mr. Hudya: The reason is we want to know users feedback if we made the stories look like this

278
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Mr. Hudya: Because typically like Wattpad if clicked the whole story will appear immidiately

279
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Mr. Hudya: But the reason we made it like this is we want to give the cuteness side to users

280
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,280
Mr. Hudya: So that's why there's a short text like "Hey, how are you today?"

281
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,280
Mr. Hudya: We hope that can be like an opening to the story

282
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,280
Mr. Hudya: So they can skip if their first impression about the opening is not very interested

283
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Mr. Hudya: but if they interested they can click the arrow and the whole story will appear

284
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Mr. Hudya: And why the comment is in the lower side, I will also answer that we still A/B test

285
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Mr. Hudya: But we also understand that the flaw from this UI that the text is quite tricky

286
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Mr. Hudya: And we have a plan to develop it better

287
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Mr. Hudya: We also know there's a bug that the text overflowed to the comment box

288
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:17,280
Mr. Hudya: But we can't make up this quick, so we solve the problems one by one cause we are still a startup

289
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Mr. Hudya: And then about the comment that crashed

290
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Mr. Hudya: Oh right, the comment was overflowed and I know that's a bug

291
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:43,280
Mr. Hudya: And the reason we put it there because if they just want to comment they can comment quickly

292
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:54,280
Mr. Hudya: Because of our users behavior that like just give a sign to a post like in Twitter

293
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Mr. Hudya: And actually the behavior of all social media is just the same, so we try to created it like this to see that it's worked

294
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Mr. Hudya: If it worked let's continue, but if not let's do a pivot

295
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Mr. Hudya: I think that's from me, my reasoning is all about community because we very understand our community behavior

296
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:21,280
Mr. Hudya: And we still A/B test, we don't declare that this is us, we still attempting

297
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:30,280
Mr. Hudya: And why we still attempting? Because we don't have an investor, we still bootstraping, so if we just attempting there's not harmed party

298
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:39,280
Mr. Hudya: And if our users just run away, I'm sure they'll come back cause they don't have other option for anonymous apps

299
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,280
Mr. Hudya: Because we are still more popular from other anonymous apps that I surveyed

300
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Mr. Hudya: I think that's from me, if want to know about the android engineering you can ask my CTO Tivo, and if about UI/UX I give it to Cornell

301
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,280
Mr. Hudya: Ok guys I'll leave a moment, I think the next would be Cornell or Tivo

302
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Mr. Tivo: Ok I think from me

303
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Mr. Hudya: Vo, I leave the burger menu problem

304
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,280
Mr. Tivo: Allright

305
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Mr. Tivo: Actually a lot of my notes are already told by Hudya

306
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Mr. Tivo: The reason we made it like that because of our users needs

307
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Mr. Tivo: And the other reason is we still bootstraping, oh excuse me, we still A/B test

308
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:48,280
Mr. Tivo: So we always improving about which the best approach for our users

309
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,280
Mr. Tivo: Actually most of my comments have been told by Hudya, but...

310
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,280
Mr. Tivo: Some of my comments like about dashboard, can I look the dashboard again?

311
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:19,280
Mr. Tivo: Ah here it is, the first thing is I see there's a burger menu here

312
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Mr. Tivo: The reason we don't put a burger menu there because we think it's "old school"

313
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:45,280
Mr. Tivo: I can tell that most of old android apps designs are using burger menu

314
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:55,280
Mr. Tivo: And the other reason we don't use it because it's too far, most of our users use the apps just with one hand

315
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:03,280
Mr. Tivo: Like scrolling with just right hand, and I think we all are the same not only our users

316
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,280
Mr. Tivo: We like to scroll with just right hand

317
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:20,280
Mr. Tivo: And then we must click the icon that on the left upper side, I think it's can be difficult so that's why we don't implement it

318
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:29,280
Mr. Tivo: And now I think a lot of apps have move on from burger menu

319
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:43,280
Mr. Tivo: About the dashboard I think the idea is good. It's focusing the whole features on one point

320
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:52,280
Mr. Tivo: But the flaw is the content here become messy

321
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,280
Mr. Tivo: For example like in the burger menu

322
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:12,280
Mr. Tivo: Yes it is, the content is messy. Users will be confused what is "My Profile", what is "My Posts", what is "My Stories", what is "My Bookmark", and what is "My Library"

323
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Mr. Tivo: Like in the current design we are fully separating the Fun Corner and the Stories

324
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Mr. Tivo: For example My Profile, actually there's not a Profile generally

325
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:44,280
Mr. Tivo: But there is a My Profile in Stories, actually it's the Profile of the stories

326
00:43:44,280 --> 00:44:03,280
Mr. Tivo: To show how are the users doing with Stories, we also have a plan to make Badges, and many more like achievements

327
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,280
Mr. Tivo: That's for My Profile

328
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:23,280
Mr. Tivo: And my point about the dashboard is the part is not quitely clear. And can we back to the dashboard please?

329
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:31,280
Mr. Tivo: I think the Trending is good

330
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:44,280
Mr. Tivo: I understand Azzam's purpose to highlight all of the points like Topic on Twitter

331
00:44:45,280 --> 00:45:02,280
Mr. Tivo: But on mobile the UI must be improved, because what users think about that is that's only an information

332
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,280
Mr. Tivo: It might can be a card, typically card

333
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:24,280
Mr. Tivo: And I still don't know was Azzam created it if we click there'll be topics related to it or not, that's the point

334
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:37,280
Mr. Tivo: And then back again to the swipe menu; the banner. There are Stories and Fun Corner

335
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:46,280
Mr. Tivo: We won't make the menu like that in our deal

336
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:56,280
Mr. Tivo: Because that's a banner and we think it's not quite right. Banner is usually for information

337
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:04,280
Mr. Tivo: Like Azzam mentioned earlier about put the Announcement in the banner I think that's a good advice

338
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:15,280
Mr. Tivo: But if the main features is put in the banner I think the users will be confused

339
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,280
Mr. Tivo: Hmmmm, what else...

340
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,280
Mr. Tivo: And then back again to Fun Corner

341
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:51,280
Mr. Tivo: I apreciate your advice about the spaces on the right and left side

342
00:46:51,280 --> 00:47:07,280
Mr. Tivo: It's a good point, but like Hudya said we have tried that and we are still bootstraping, but we always look for users feedback

343
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,280
Mr. Tivo: But I think it's a good point

344
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:19,280
Mr. Tivo: And then about action button like Love and Share

345
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:25,280
Mr. Tivo: We are focusing it to the lower right side, why?

346
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:36,280
Mr. Tivo: Because we want the users to easily reach it with one hand, so they don't need the other hand to click it

347
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:45,280
Mr. Tivo: If the device is small I think it's ok, but if it's quite big like a Note Series I think that would be a problem

348
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:59,280
Mr. Tivo: But if it just an information like the comment amount or seen status I think that's ok

349
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:08,280
Mr. Tivo: Overall good especially the Popular and Recent that's a good advice

350
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,280
Mr. Tivo: Good job, I think that's from me

351
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,280
Azzam: Ok thank you

352
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,280
Mr. Hudya: Cornell, do you want to talk?

353
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,280
Ms. Cornell: I think all have been told throughoutly

354
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,280
Ms. Cornell: From me probably only about the margin

355
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,280
Ms. Cornell: What else...

356
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:52,280
Ms. Cornell: For the banner concern I want to inform about an article named "CTA (Call To Action)"

357
00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:00,280
Ms. Cornell: That's also about engaging with users, but overall have been told by Hudya

358
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:11,280
Ms. Cornell: And then the typography could be researched more about the fonts, for the differantiation which have to be highlighted and not

359
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,280
Ms. Cornell: And then what else...., I think all have been told

360
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:27,280
Ms. Cornell: And if you want to know which the design good or not, like Hudya said just remember that the users's desire is critical

361
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:36,280
Ms. Cornell: Althought we think it's good, but the one that use it is users, and they will go away if they don't like it

362
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,280
Ms. Cornell: And the line spacing must be considered too

363
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:51,280
Mr. Hudya: Overall good job guys, I really apreciate it for a third semester student I think it's amazing seriously

364
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,280
Rudi & Azzam: Thank you very much

365
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:04,280
Mr. Hudya: Because you're don't have a design basics too but you can give an advice and an analysis althought it's subjective but that's ok

366
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,280
Mr. Hudya: But at least the point is you now understand from the developer side why we made it that way

367
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,280
Mr. Hudya:  Because we know you still haven't know the feel facing with users directly

368
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:22,280
Mr. Hudya: Seriously guys the users are very captious, although it's just a one second error but the rating will drop significanly

369
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:34,280
Mr. Hudya: But we also want to inform from the developer side although we made a design that doesn't make any sense, but what can we say if the users like it

370
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:46,280
Mr. Hudya: But indeed we will always improving, although they like it we will improve the UI so that it won't out of general principles

371
00:50:50,280 --> 00:51:02,280
Rudi: Thank you for all, hopefully we can increase our knowledge

372
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,280
Rudi: Is there something you want to add?

373
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:15,280
Faris: I think from me is I want to thank you for the feedbacks

374
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:23,280
Faris: And I also want to sorry for the critics although we are just 3rd semester students, I think that's from me

375
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:39,280
Azzam: I also want to thank you for the feedback of my design, and now I understand why is the developer made it like that

376
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:50,280
Azzam: So in the future I can improve my UI/UX design not only from my view but with user's view too

377
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,280
Azzam: Thank you very much for the feedbacks, I think that's it

378
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,280
Mr. Hudya: Why don't you release that so we can rivaling?

379
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,280
Rudi: Rivaling....?!

380
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:07,280
Rudi: We are still in 3rd semester, we stll can't don anything
Mr. Hudya: That will be interesting....

381
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,280
Mr. Hudya: Indeed, the point is you're from the one that can't do anything become the one that can do something

382
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:19,280
Mr. Hudya: We also make Tell from zero, from we can't do anything, still dumb in coding, but there it is now

383
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,280
Mr. Hudya: You have three people there, there can be UI/UX one,the mobile one, the back-end one

384
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:30,280
Mr. Hudya: Or suppose you want to release only a front-end website that's ok, at least you're trying

385
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:40,280
Rudi: Thank you for the advice, we really have new isights from you all

386
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:47,280
Rudi: For the addition I think we can talk it after this, probably now we will do a closing

387
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,280
Mr. Hudya: Yes of course

388
00:52:49,280 --> 00:53:01,280
Rudi: Okay that's it for this assignment, see you on the next assignment
